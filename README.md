## Project Overview
This project aims to assist farmers by suggesting the best crops to plant based on multiple environmental factors such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. We utilize several machine learning models to achieve high accuracy in crop recommendations.

## Features
- Crop prediction based on soil parameters.
- Multiple machine learning models: Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- Model performance comparison and accuracy evaluation.
- Heatmap to visualize the correlation between features.
- Ability to make predictions for new data inputs.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - xgboost
  - pickle (for saving models)

## Getting Started
